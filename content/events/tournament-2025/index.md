⚽️ 🏆 🥳 Residents of Oakley. 👋 📣 It’s that time of year again!

This bank holiday weekend, 3000+ people will flock to the Peter Houseman Playing Fields for the annual Oakley FC Six-A-Side Football Tournament. ⚽️

Over 150 teams, U7-U16, proper fun grassroots football, fast and furious short matches. Come & watch, have a bite to eat and a mingle, bump into people you know. 😊 £2.50 entry, kids go free. It’s a fabulous community event with a great atmosphere, raising money for the club and for local cancer charity Sebastian’s Action Trust. 🤗

🚙 🚗 🚙 Please PLEASE (as always) expect traffic congestion on Oakley Lane on both Saturday and Sunday, especially around the school and shops. 🚙 🚗 🚙

Car parking is in the school grounds and the access is one way / single file, so please be patient! 🙏 Our parking stewards 😇 😇 😇 will be doing their very best to avoid gridlock, however it is likely to be busy both days between 7.45-9am … and the am-to-pm changeover of 12-2.30pm will be the busiest time by far – we advise going the long way round the village. 🔄

NB: Peter Houseman field itself is not open for public use this weekend ⛔️ and is disabled parking and access only.

On the Tournify app (link below) you can find all the groups, timings and results updated in real time.
All our burgers 🍔 and sausages 🌭 come from Wally’s V&B Butchers, we are supported by a number of local businesses, and teams come to play from all over Basingstoke and Hampshire, Berkshire, Surrey and Wiltshire.

So, may the best teams win! 🥇 Good luck to all our Oakley players! 😉🤞☘️ We hope everyone has a splendid couple of days! 🥳

Thank you in advance for your patience about traffic congestion or disruption. 🚙 🚗 🚙

We really appreciate all your support. 😊 – on behalf of Oakley FC. ⚽️
